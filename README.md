# Bot discord Multi Option 

Hi there 👋,

Let me explain how to set up the bot so it works without any issues! 🚀
First, you'll need to go to the config.json file. WARNING, there are 3 files to configure: one in commands, one in events, and one in the main folder.

You'll need to enter your bot's token, client ID, and guild ID in all 3 files! 🔐

Once that's done, run the bot by executing node index.js! 🎉
